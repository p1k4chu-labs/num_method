# Numerical Methods Playground

Welcome to the Numerical Methods Playground! This repository is a collection of interactive web applications designed to visualize and solve various numerical methods problems.

## About This Project

This project was brought to life with the assistance of Gemini, Google's large language model. It serves as a creative and experimental space to explore the fascinating world of numerical analysis. The goal is to provide intuitive and educational tools for students, educators, and anyone with a curiosity for mathematics and computer science.

Each application is crafted to be a standalone, single-page experience, focusing on a specific numerical method. Dive in, experiment with different inputs, and see the methods in action!

### Disclaimer

While the applications are designed to be functional and accurate, they are intended for educational and experimental purposes. Always double-check critical calculations with a reliable source.
